    "##### Overview of Algorithm:\n",
    "The People Detection Algorithm utilizes a stripped down version the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model i.e YOLOv4-tiny as the object detection model (in this case people detection), it was created by Joseph Redmond and it acheives Real-time object detection. The Algorithm runs on the python programming language and uses functions and methods from OpenCv and imutils libraries and is applied on a video sequence of people walking by in a university (common and busy area), so there are occlusions and overlapping people in the frames.

    "##### Model Evaluation:\n",
    "1. The model used is the fourth version of the YOLO series\n",
    "2. The YOLO machine learning models applies a single neural network to the image by, splitting the image into regions and calculating the probabilities for each region, as opposed to some other models that implement localizers and classifiers at multiple scales and locations on the image. \n",
    "3. YOLOv4-tiny is a \"lite\" or stripped down version of the Original version 4, for acheiving real-time processing (avg 9fps) by prioritizing Speed over Accuracy, while still providing accurate results which can further be influenced via threshold values\n",
    "4. It retains global context since the image is viewed at once (as a whole)\n",
    "5. The model being implemented (the YOLOv4-tiny) is 8 times faster than the original YOLOv4, requiring less computation time and achieving better real-time processing due to the fact that it makes use of 29 pre-trained convolutional layers as opposed to 129 pre-trained layers."
